        <div><h2>Salmon River Rafting</h2>
            <p>The Salmon River flows 425 miles, drains over 14,000 square miles and drops more than 7,000 vertical feet from 
                its headwaters. Natural and untamed, the Salmon River is protected by Congress as one of America‚Äôs first Wild 
                and Scenic Rivers. It has shaped its course through a rugged and diverse landscape providing unique river trips 
                you will only experience in Idaho.</p>

                mean you shouldn't! Each section of river, offers something unique.</p>
