            <h2>Interesting Preston City Facts</h2>
            <img  class="smallImgTxt" src="images/yellowflowers.jpg" alt="preston small photo">
            <h3>Preston was almost named Worm Creek</h3>
                <p>In 1866, Latter-day Saint pioneers arrived in the northern end of the Cache Valley, 
                stretching across southeastern Idaho and northeastern Utah. They founded a community in that location 
                and named it Worm Creek, because the waterways in the area resembled worms as they curved and wound 
                their way through the countryside. (Another story relates that it was actually WARM Creek, because of 
                the many hot springs in the area, but someone got it wrong and WORM Creek stuck!) But in 1881 changed 
                it to Preston because leaders of the LDS Church in Salt 
                Lake City objected to the name "Worm Creek" being part of any church congregation's name. The name 
                Preston was suggested by a local member to honor William B. Preston, who at the time was president 
                of the LDS Church's Cache Stake.</p>
            <h3>“You gonna eat your tots?”</h3>
                <p>Much of the 2004 film Napoleon Dynamite was shot in the city of Preston, including at Preston High School, 
                located several blocks from U.S. Highway 91. Several area landmarks can be seen throughout the film. 
                Preston is the home of the film's creators, Jared and Jerusha Hess; Jared attended high school in Preston.</p>

            <h3>Got lights? Preston has a festival of them!</h3>    
                <p>Each year Preston holds the "Idaho Festival of Lights", which starts the day after Thanksgiving and goes 
                until December 31. The festival was started by two local business men (Wayne Bell and Walter Ross) 
                along with many other community organizations to help celebrate Christmas within the community. 
                The festival consists of a lighted parade, fireworks, and displays in the city park. The merchants 
                along the main street of Preston have their store fronts decorated with Christmas lights during the festival.
                A key event of the festival is the International Bed Race, which is held on the Saturday following Thanksgiving 
                on the main street of Preston. Additional events are a kids' parade and free movie.</p>
            <h3>What's Preston like?</h3>
                <p>Preston, Idaho is one of the best kept secrets of the West.  Nestled on the Idaho side of beautiful Cache Valley 
                    and surrounded by towering mountains on each side, it is unbeatable for recreation opportunities, has that small 
                    town feeling, and is close to whatever you need. 

                    It is one of the safest places to live in the State of Idaho and in Cache Valley. </p>
