        <h2>Intresting Soda Springs Facts</h2>
        <img class="smallImgTxt2" src="images/soda.jpg" alt="small photo">
        <h3>Where did Soda Springs get its name?</h3>
        <p>The city is named for the hundreds of natural springs of carbonated water 
            that are located in and around the city. The springs were well known to Native 
            Americans and were a famous landmark along the Oregon Trail in the middle 19th century. 
            Today the city is also known as the location of the Soda Springs Geyser, which was unleashed in 1934 when 
            "town fathers" were looking for hot water for a "hot pool" bathing attraction.</p> 
        <h3>Soda Springs is also the home of the worldâ€™s largest man-made geyser. </h3>    
            <p>The geyser was created in 1937 when engineers were attempting to find a hot water source for a swimming pool. 
            On November 30, 1937, the drill went down 315 feet and unleashed the geyser. The extreme pressure. caused by carbon dioxide
            gas mixing with water in an underground chamber, caused water to shoot 100 feet into the sky. It is 
            now capped and controlled by a timer and erupts every hour on the hour. It is the only captive geyser in the world.</p>
